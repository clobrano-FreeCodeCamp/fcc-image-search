  p Welcome to #{title} a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images.
  p 
    |The specs of this microservice come from 
    a(href='https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/image-search-abstraction-layer') FreeCode Camp challenge
    |:
  ul
    li User Story: I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
    li User Story: I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
    li User Story: I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.

  p 
    |to search for images, use the api: .../api/imagesearch/query[?offset=N], like 
    a(href='api/imagesearch/new york?offset=10') here

  p 
    |to see the latest search, use the api: .../api/latest/imagesearch, like 
    a(href='api/latest/imagesearch') here
    |. I modified a bit the specs here and only the last 10 search will be showed.
